# VerseLink - Test Results & Communications

## Testing Protocol

### Communication with Testing Agents
- **Backend Testing**: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend API testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX testing
- **Always ask user before starting frontend testing**: Use `ask_human` tool to confirm
- **Read this file before each testing session** to understand current state
- **Update this file after each development cycle** with latest findings

### Testing Sequence
1. **Backend First**: Always test backend changes with `deep_testing_backend_v2`
2. **Frontend After**: Only test frontend if explicitly requested by user
3. **Integration Testing**: Test complete user flows end-to-end

### Current Development Phase
**Phase 4: Notifications & Moderation** - Backend Complete, Frontend In Progress

### User Problem Statement
Build "VerseLink," a comprehensive web platform for Star Citizen corporations and players. Platform should organize inter-Discord federated events and manage competitions with bracket systems. Features dark/spatial theme similar to "starmarket" style.

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + MongoDB + Beanie ODM
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + Vite
- **Authentication**: Discord OAuth 2.0
- **Database**: MongoDB with UUID-based document IDs

### Current Implementation Status

#### Phase 4 - Backend (COMPLETE ✅)
- ✅ Models: notification.py with all notification and moderation models
- ✅ Services: notification_service.py, moderation_service.py
- ✅ Routers: notifications.py, moderation.py with full CRUD
- ✅ Database indexes configured in server.py
- ✅ All API endpoints functional (98.9% test success rate - 87/88 tests passed)

#### Phase 4 - Frontend (COMPLETE ✅)
- ✅ NotificationBell.js component created and integrated in Navbar
- ✅ notificationService.js created
- ✅ NotificationsPage.js created for full notification management
- ✅ NotificationPreferencesPage.js created for user preferences
- ✅ moderationService.js created
- ✅ ReportUserModal.js component created for abuse reporting
- ✅ ModerationDashboardPage.js created for admin moderation interface
- ✅ App.js updated with new routes (/notifications, /notifications/preferences, /admin/moderation)
- ✅ Frontend interface tested and working correctly

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Phase 4 COMPLETE - Notifications & Moderation system fully implemented
2. Ready to proceed to Phase 5 as requested by user
3. All backend APIs tested and working (98.9% success rate)
4. All frontend components implemented and integrated
5. System ready for production use of notifications and moderation features

### Testing Notes
- Backend APIs are fully functional and tested
- All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- Authentication and authorization working correctly
- Admin-only endpoints properly protected
- Error handling implemented correctly
- API structure follows REST conventions

### Issues & Solutions
- **Minor**: One network timeout during testing (not a backend issue)
- **Resolved**: All authentication endpoints returning correct status codes
- **Resolved**: All Phase 4 APIs properly integrated and functional

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed to complete Phase 4 before moving to Phase 5
- Focus on notifications and moderation features completion
- Backend implementation complete and ready for frontend integration
