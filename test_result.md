# VerseLink - Test Results & Communications

## Testing Protocol

### Communication with Testing Agents
- **Backend Testing**: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend API testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX testing
- **Always ask user before starting frontend testing**: Use `ask_human` tool to confirm
- **Read this file before each testing session** to understand current state
- **Update this file after each development cycle** with latest findings

### Testing Sequence
1. **Backend First**: Always test backend changes with `deep_testing_backend_v2`
2. **Frontend After**: Only test frontend if explicitly requested by user
3. **Integration Testing**: Test complete user flows end-to-end

### Current Development Phase
**Phase 4: Notifications & Moderation** - In Progress

### User Problem Statement
Build "VerseLink," a comprehensive web platform for Star Citizen corporations and players. Platform should organize inter-Discord federated events and manage competitions with bracket systems. Features dark/spatial theme similar to "starmarket" style.

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + MongoDB + Beanie ODM
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + Vite
- **Authentication**: Discord OAuth 2.0
- **Database**: MongoDB with UUID-based document IDs

### Current Implementation Status

#### Phase 4 - Backend (COMPLETE ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ Models: notification.py with all notification and moderation models
- ‚úÖ Services: notification_service.py, moderation_service.py
- ‚úÖ Routers: notifications.py, moderation.py with full CRUD
- ‚úÖ Database indexes configured in server.py
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints functional

#### Phase 4 - Frontend (IN PROGRESS üîÑ)
- ‚úÖ NotificationBell.js component created
- ‚úÖ notificationService.js created
- ‚ùå NotificationBell not integrated in Navbar yet
- ‚ùå Missing notification pages (/notifications, /notifications/preferences)
- ‚ùå Missing moderation service frontend
- ‚ùå Missing moderation pages/components
- ‚ùå Missing report abuse functionality

### Next Steps
1. Integrate NotificationBell in Navbar
2. Create notification management pages
3. Create moderation frontend service
4. Create moderation pages for admins
5. Test complete notification & moderation system

### Testing Notes
- Backend APIs are ready for testing
- Frontend components need integration testing after completion
- User authentication required for all notification features
- Admin role required for moderation features

### Issues & Solutions
(To be updated during development and testing)

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed to complete Phase 4 before moving to Phase 5
- Focus on notifications and moderation features completion
