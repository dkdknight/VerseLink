# VerseLink - Test Results & Communications

## Testing Protocol

### Communication with Testing Agents
- **Backend Testing**: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend API testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX testing
- **Always ask user before starting frontend testing**: Use `ask_human` tool to confirm
- **Read this file before each testing session** to understand current state
- **Update this file after each development cycle** with latest findings

### Testing Sequence
1. **Backend First**: Always test backend changes with `deep_testing_backend_v2`
2. **Frontend After**: Only test frontend if explicitly requested by user
3. **Integration Testing**: Test complete user flows end-to-end

### Current Development Phase
**Phase 4: Tournaments & Brackets** - COMPLETE ✅

### User Problem Statement
Build "VerseLink," a comprehensive web platform for Star Citizen corporations and players. Platform should organize inter-Discord federated events and manage competitions with bracket systems. Features dark/spatial theme similar to "starmarket" style.

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + MongoDB + Beanie ODM
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + Vite
- **Authentication**: Discord OAuth 2.0
- **Database**: MongoDB with UUID-based document IDs
